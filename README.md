# Yawning Detection

## Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time driver yawning detection system** using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system detects yawns from a live camera feed, classifies them, and triggers alerts to prevent driver drowsiness, enhancing road safety.



## Features
- Real-time detection of yawns using **Mediapipe and OpenCV**
- Visual feedback with **facial landmarks** for better accuracy
- **3-Zone Alert System** based on yawn frequency:
  - **Green Zone:** Normal  
  - **Yellow Zone:** Caution  
  - **Red Zone:** Alert (triggers buzzer or notification)
- Works on **live webcam feed**  



## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy, Pygame (for alerts)  
- **Machine Learning Model:** YOLOv8 (optional for advanced detection)
